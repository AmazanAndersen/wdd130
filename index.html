        <p> I’m Andersen Amazan, a huge fan of Harvey Specter from the TV show *Suits*. I’m originally from Haiti, but right now I’m living in Argentina. Football and sports are a big part of my life, and I’m always grateful for my mom, my bed, and my faith in God. Coding is another passion of mine, as it keeps me engaged and learning. I also enjoy spending time at the beach, watching sunsets, and cherishing moments with my family. These simple joys are what make life special for me.</p>
